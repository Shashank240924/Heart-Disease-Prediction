Heart Disease Risk Prediction🫀
Project OverviewThis project develops a high-reliability machine learning pipeline to predict the 10-year risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) using the Framingham clinical dataset.
While many models focus solely on accuracy, this project is optimized for Recall, ensuring that high-risk patients are correctly identified to prevent missed diagnoses in a clinical setting.Key FeaturesEnd-to-End Pipeline: Data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model deployment.
Handling Class Imbalance: Integrated SMOTETomek (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique combined with Tomek Links) to handle the skewed distribution of heart disease cases.
Performance Optimization: Transitioned from a baseline Logistic Regression to a Random Forest Classifier to capture complex, non-linear health patterns.Clinical Focus: Optimized for AUC-ROC (0.85+) and Recall, prioritizing the reduction of False Negatives.
Tech StackLanguage: Python 3.10+Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPyVisualization: Matplotlib, SeabornMachine Learning: Scikit-Learn, Imbalanced-Learn (SMOTE)The Data Science Workflow1.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)I performed a deep dive into the dataset to identify the most significant predictors.Key Insight: Features like sysBP (Systolic Blood Pressure), age, and cigsPerDay showed the strongest correlation with 10-year CHD risk.2. PreprocessingHandled missing values through listwise deletion to maintain data integrity.
Applied StandardScaler to normalize feature scales, preventing the model from being biased toward higher-value units like totChol.3.
